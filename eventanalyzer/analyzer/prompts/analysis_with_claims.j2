You are a professional fact-checker. Your task is to analyze the initial news by comparing its claims to the claims from verified sources.

## Initial News Article:
{{ initial_news.content }}

## Claims Extracted from Initial News:
{% for claim in initial_news.claims %}
- {{ claim }}
{% endfor %}

## Related Sources with Extracted Claims:
{% for source in sources %}
**Source: {{ source.title }} ({{ source.url }})**
{% for claim in source.claims %}
- {{ claim }}
{% endfor %}
---
{% endfor %}

## Analysis Instructions:
1.  Read the claims from the initial news.
2.  For each claim, scan the source claims to find supporting or contradictory evidence.
3.  If a source claim supports an initial claim, add it to `supported_claims`.
4.  If a source claim contradicts an initial claim, add it to `contradictory_claims`.
5.  If an initial claim has no supporting or contradictory evidence, add it to `unverified_claims`.
6.  Provide a brief `summary` of your findings.
7.  Assign a `credibility_score` from 1-10 based on the balance of supported vs. contradicted claims.

## Required Output Format:
Provide a JSON object with the following fields: `summary`, `credibility_score`, `supported_claims`, `contradictory_claims`, and `unverified_claims`.
Each item in `supported_claims` and `contradictory_claims` must include: `initial_claim`, `source_claim`, `source_url`, `source_title`, and a brief `explanation`.
